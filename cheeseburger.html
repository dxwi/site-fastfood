<p>In Jerusalem, McDonalds had to open up two different restaraunts, <br>one being kosher and the other being non-kosher. This was controversial due<br> to the cheeseburgers containing cheese.</p>
<p>Lionel Sternberger had created the cheeseburger in 1926, he was a fry cook at his father's business.</p>
<p>When cheeseburgers were introduced, they were sold for 25 cents.</p>
