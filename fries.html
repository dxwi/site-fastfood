<p>French fries at McDonalds contains 93% of a beefmixture, this led to a lawsuit when they mislabelled their fries as vegeterian.<br>
To settle the lawsuit, McDonalds had to donate money to Hindus and other groups alike.<br></p>
<p>McDonalds and other fast food chains in the 1960s are responsible for the 'thin style' fries.</p>
<p>The fries that McDonalds are provided with are not freshly cut from potatoes, <br>but frozen fries from suppliers, this has been happening since 1967.</p>
